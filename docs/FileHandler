File Handler Documantation.
---------------------------------------------
Request for file

---------------------------------------------
-'string': opens file with name 'string' and then reads all it's content and then sends it to Program control.
    Ex: 'string' = file1.txt. sendToProgramControl(read(file1.txt))
-'': Read name of all files and send the names of the files to Program control.
    Ex: when there is n files. sendToProgramControl("file names:" + " file1.txt" + " file2.txt" + ... + "filen.txt")
