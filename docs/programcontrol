Program Control

this class will have a function, something like handleArgs, that is called by the user interface with valid arguments
it will call one of two functions from the file handler, either getting the list of files to print or getting the content of a file
if handleArgs gets the content of a file, it will then call the decipherer on that file
handleArgs will finally print either the list of files or a deciphered file

Test ideas:
get list of files when no arguments are present and print the list
get file contents, deciper them, and print them
