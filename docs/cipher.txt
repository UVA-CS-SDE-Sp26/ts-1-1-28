cipher.txt - Member D docs
===========================

What my part does:
I handle the deciphering. When program control gives me encrypted text
I use the key file to turn it back into normal readable text.

The key file (ciphers/key.txt):
- two lines
- line 1 is the real characters
- line 2 is what they got changed to
- our key:
    abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ1234567890
    bcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ1234567890a
- basically everything shifts forward by 1
- includes lowercase uppercase and numbers
- so like 'b' in the encrypted version is actually 'a'

How my code works:
- reads the key file, makes a hashmap that goes cipher char -> plain char
- validates the key (same length lines, no duplicates, file exists, etc)
- decipher() goes through each character, looks it up in the map,
  and swaps it. if its not in the map (like a space or period) it
  just stays the same

Using it:
  Cipher c = new Cipher();              // uses default key
  Cipher c = new Cipher("other.txt");   // uses different key
  c.validateKey();                       // true if its good
  c.decipher("ifmmp");                  // returns "hello"

If the key is bad it throws an IllegalStateException when you try to decipher

How it fits with everyone else:
  A gets the command line input
  C tells B to read the file
  B gives the encrypted text to C  
  C gives it to me (D) to decipher
  I give back the clean text
  C sends it to A to print

If theres a second command line argument thats an alternate key file
so C would do new Cipher("thatfile.txt") instead of new Cipher()

My tests (30):
- key validation: good key, mismatched lengths, duplicate chars (both lines),
  missing file, empty file, one line, empty lines, extra third line
- basic decipher: simple word, single char, empty string, null
- special cases: spaces/punctuation, capitals, all caps, numbers,
  wraparound (a -> 0), whitespace, just punctuation, full sentence
- alternate keys: different key, tiny 3 char key
- errors: bad key throws exception, mismatched key throws exception,
  no error on good key, has error on bad key
- getters: path getter, default path, map contents, map is a copy
- other: map has 62 entries, newlines work, longer text
